            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Majid, a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong focus on JavaScript and building dynamic, user-friendly web applications. With experience in crafting clean, efficient, and interactive websites, I specialize in turning complex ideas into seamless, responsive, and visually appealing web experiences. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills to keep up with the rapidly changing front-end development landscape.

                I work primarily with JavaScript, along with modern frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, and Node.js, to create high-performing applications that run smoothly across devices. My goal is to write clean, maintainable code and ensure optimal performance for every project I take on. I am also passionate about the user experience (UX) and accessibility (a11y), ensuring that the websites I build are both functional and inclusive.</p>

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I’m a front-end developer driven by a deep passion for creating intuitive and beautiful user experiences. My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how websites are built and a desire to make my own ideas come to life on the web. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in JavaScript and modern front-end technologies, always eager to learn and stay ahead of industry trends.

            I am particularly drawn to the intersection of design and development. I believe that great development isn’t just about writing code—it’s about solving problems, understanding users, and creating interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing. Every project I work on is an opportunity for me to learn, grow, and collaborate with other like-minded professionals to craft the best possible product.
            
            When I’m not coding, I’m always exploring new technologies and working on personal projects to sharpen my skills. I’m a strong advocate for continuous learning and improving through real-world experience, whether that’s taking online courses, participating in hackathons, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe that staying curious and constantly challenging myself.</p></div>
